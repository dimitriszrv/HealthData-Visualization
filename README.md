## About

Initially, to create the database, all the data from the Gapminder page is processed in CSV format, a final CSV is created that contains all the data in one file. Based on the above aggregate CSV file, the database, which consists of a table, was created. Its columns are the various indexes while each row is a pair of country and date.

The software was implemented as a desktop application using JavaFx.
